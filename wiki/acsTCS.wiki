= Project Brief =

ACS-TSC is a project developing on ACS framework to control the telescope of the Sirius Observatory of Universidad Católica del Norte. This project is integrated by students of the college in their majors of Computer Science Engineering. The pourpose of the software is controling the MEADE LX200 Telescope with a GUI developed in Java and a ACS component to execute the respective functions of the telescope by a serial connection.

  In astronomy, a celestial coordinate system is a coordinate system for mapping positions on the celestial sphere. There are different celestial coordinate systems each using a system of spherical coordinates projected on the celestial sphere, in analogy to the geographic coordinate system used on the surface of the Earth. The coordinate systems differ only in their choice of the fundamental plane, which divides the sky into two equalhemispheres along a great circle. For example, the fundamental plane of the geographic system is the Earth's equator. Each coordinate system is named for its choice of fundamental plane.

= Planification =

There are 3 steps of implementation:

==Serial Port Conection==

Implement the interface between Serial Port and the ACS Modules.

==ACS Developing==

  * Study and design an ACS implementation for controlling the telescope.
  * Implement the component, the CDB schema and the IDL.
  * Document the development process.

==GUI Client==

  * Study developing of GUI on Java Swing.
  * Implement a simple Java interface in Swing.
