#summary This guide will show you how to install the gCCD software

= Introduction =

Here you will learn how to deploy, install and how to configure the software in a distributed enviroment.

= Requirements =

In order for the software to work, you must first have ACS installed and working on each host where the software will be deployed. See these pages:

 * *[PlatformConfiguration Platform configuration]*
 * *[ACSInstallation ACS installation]*

= Deployment =

gCCD uses ACS as a framework to enable distributed deplyoment of the system. The software is divided roughly in three different logical parts:

*The CCD camera component
*The GUI client
*The Bulk data transfer and notificacion system

== The CCD camera component ==

This is the software that offers the ACS interface to manipulate the supported cameras.

== The GUI client ==

This is the graphical user interface that the operator uses to control de CCD through the CCD component.

== Bulk data transfer and notification system ==

The bulk data transfer system provided by ACS consists of a "sender" and "receiver" component that allow the transference of big files. The notification system also provided by ACS is used in order to inform the client of the arrival of files.

== Deployment scenario ==

Since this software has been built as a distributed system the basic deployment scenario consists of three host machines:

=== ACS Daemons ===

In order to avoid setup of the system (containers, acs, etc) each time you use it, you can use the ACS daemons to start containers on-demand whenever a component is requested from the client (or any other ACS/CORBA component to that matter).

The CDB container configuration files found in config/MACI/Containers/ for each container must be modified to contain the hostname of the machine where the container is supposed to run on. Here is an example:

{{{

</Container>
