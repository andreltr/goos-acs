GOOS stands for "Generic Observatory Operation System".

The objective of this project is to create an integrated software/hardware platform to control telescopes and instruments and to transfer the captured data to a centralized storage. The software part of this system will be based on [ALMA Common Software](http://www.eso.org/~almamgr/AlmaAcs/) (ACS).

For a more detailed description of the project, see this [page](WhatIsGOOS.md)

Currently, this site hosts the code for two sub-projects:

  * [gCCD](ProjectGccd.md), a software to operate CCD cameras utilizing ACS
  * [gDome](ProjectGdome.md), a newly created project to create software to operate a dome.

The source code is [here](http://code.google.com/p/goos-acs/source/browse/#svn/trunk).

The gTCS software and other related projects are hosted by the ALMA-UTFSM group at this [site](https://csrg.inf.utfsm.cl/twiki4/bin/view/ACS/AcsUtfsmAbout). Among the participants of this initiative, the ALMA-UTFSM group was the first to work on ACS-related proyects.
